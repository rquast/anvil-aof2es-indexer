# Anvil Connect User Sync

## Description

The purpose of this daemon is to read and tail append only files (Redis AOF mode) generated by Anvil Connect, and send user, role and scope information to RethinkDB. This gives you the ability to search on the metadata of users, roles, clients and scopes, which is not (currently) provided by the rest/v1 routes in Anvil Connect.
